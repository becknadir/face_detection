Place your face images in this directory following this naming format:

person_name_number.jpg (or .png)

Examples:
- john_1.jpg
- john_2.jpg
- alice_1.jpg

The name before the last underscore will be used as the identity label during face recognition. 
Using multiple images of the same person (with different numbers) can improve recognition accuracy.

For best results:
1. Use clear, well-lit images
2. Make sure the face is visible and centered
3. Try to include different angles/expressions for better recognition
4. Higher resolution images work better
